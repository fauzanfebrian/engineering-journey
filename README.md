# Engineering Journey: From Silicon to Cloud

This monorepo documents my Systems Engineering Journey. It maps the complete computing stack, from logic gates to distributed systems.

## 🗺️ The Architecture of My Learning

### Layer 1: The Hardware & Logic 💾
* **[nand2tetris](https://github.com/fauzanfebrian/nand2tetris)** — *Building a computer from scratch.*
  - **Goal:** Demystifying the CPU. Built an assembler and VM translator to understand how code becomes electricity.

### Layer 2: The Kernel & OS ⚙️
* **[xv6-riscv](https://github.com/fauzanfebrian/xv6-riscv)** — *The playground.*
  - **Key Achievement:** Copied a Go routine in C using the RISC-V pipe syscall.
* **[linux-kernel-hacking](https://github.com/fauzanfebrian/linux-kernel-hacking)** — *The real world.*
  - **Key Achievement:** Created a basic Linux kernel module.

### Layer 3: The Application & Infrastructure 🌐
* **[c-memory-playground](https://github.com/fauzanfebrian/c-memory-playground)** — *Mastering the tool.*
  - **Focus:** Manual memory management, pointers, and eliminating memory leaks.
* **[cusdeb-open-source-playground](https://github.com/fauzanfebrian/cusdeb-open-source-playground)** — *Open source contribution.*
  - **Status:** Merged PR for [Nextcloud Server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/55992).
